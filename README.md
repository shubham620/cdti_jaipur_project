about the project 

In many real-life situations like accidents, emergencies, protests, or public safety issues, information comes from different places such as social media, emergency calls, and official reports. This information is often messy, confusing, and sometimes incorrect, which makes it hard to understand what is really happening at the ground level.

This project is about building a simple AI-based system that helps make sense of such information. Instead of looking at every message separately, the system groups related messages together and treats them as one real-world event. It tries to understand the meaning of the text, not just keywords.

For each event, the system checks how reliable the information is (credibility) and how serious the situation could be (risk). It also shows how an event develops over time, from the first report to confirmation. To make things easier for users, the system displays everything on a dashboard with charts and includes an AI assistant that explains what is happening in simple words.

The main goal of this project is to show how AI can support humans in understanding complex situations and making better decisions, without replacing human judgment.
